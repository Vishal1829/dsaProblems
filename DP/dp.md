Rules for converting a memoization solution to tabular:
1. Base Case of recursion becomes the initialization values for ierative dp array.
2. Also the changing parameters in the recursive code so write down the changing parameters in
opposite fashion. So if in recursion i is going from 0 to n then in iterative it will be changed to
n to 0.
3. Copy the recurrence and also follow the coodinate shifts.
